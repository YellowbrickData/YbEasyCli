Workload Profiler for YBOS 5.X and higher


Description
This utility creates 35 day heat maps of Work Loads on a Yellowbrick Cluster in an Excel spreadsheet.
The spreadsheet will allow you to dynamically create heat maps by User, Application, Pool, and Query Step.


Preparing the Data
Run the following SQL scripts to create the data used by the spreadsheet.
The step2 SQL script needs to be run as a super user.
The step4 SQL script creates 5 CSV files used to populate the spreadsheet.

    ybsql -U <user> -h <host> -d <db> -f step0_wl_profiler_drop_objects.sql
    ybsql -U <user> -h <host> -d <db> -f step1_wl_profiler_create_objects.sql
    ybsql -U yellowbrick -h <host> -d <db> -W -f step2_wl_profiler_su_populate.sql
    ybsql -U <user> -h <host> -d <db> -f step3_wl_profiler_summarization.sql
    ybsql -U <user> -h <host> -d <db> -f step4_wl_profiler_create_csv_files.sql
    ybsql -U <user> -h <host> -d <db> -f step0_wl_profiler_drop_objects.sql


Populate the Spreadsheet
Open each CSV file in Excel.  Then copy all the data from each CSV file to the appropriate tab in the
wl_profiler.xlsm file starting in cell A2.  The following are the mappings of CSV file to tab in wl_profiler.xlsm.

    wl_profiler_data.csv to Data tab
    wl_profiler_user.csv to Totals_User tab
    wl_profiler_app.csv to Totals_App tab
    wl_profiler_pool.csv to Totals_Pool tab
    wl_profiler_step.csv to Totals_Step tab


Using the Spreadsheet
Open the WL_Profile tab in the wl_profiler.xlsm spreadsheet.
The WL_Profile tab contains pull downs for Query Step, User, Application, and Pool to build the appropriate heat map.
You will find the Query Steps, Queue and Run of most interest.
By clicking on any cell in the heat map you can then get the detail records by running the SQL Query in the first row.
